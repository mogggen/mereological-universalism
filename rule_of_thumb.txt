like a cannon that shots 

left -> cannon

down 5

and is then destroy or losing durability

cannon8 is 8

cannon7 is 7

cannon6 is cannon 8

.......


attacker is 2

###
three things 
position

the node that is drawn to screen holds the ruler's position
R: position 16 * 16, the relative position to interact with
G: tag (name)
B: ruleBase (how tags interact with each other, for example: +3 for R(position), and -3 for self.health)
A: age, healh, Value if 0

the rules are subtract n from the node that the ruler sits on and apply the same amount to the target, but sending cross channels [(R to B for examples) is equally cheap as R to R)]

###
the color is drawn and the
R = 3,5
G = Cleric
B = ruleSet.healing + ruleSet.standing
A = [heal target by one, lose tag by one][give 0 for R, take 0 from R] 

0: your position [expand...]
1: other position [expand...]

2: your action [expand...]
3: other action [expand...]

3: your durability [expand...]

###
make it intressting and don't cap and over/under flow the tag/position values.
either cap

then maybe

The drawnPosition
R = 1,1
G = SitUps
B = target (0, 0)



0: your position [expand...]
1: other position [expand...]

2: your action [expand...]
3: other action [expand...]

3: your durability [expand...]
