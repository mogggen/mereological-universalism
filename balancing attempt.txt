like with blueprint from from the unreal engine series their will be a limited set of nodes where they cost diffrent to use:
and contains the instrucion for each canvas,
and putting more nodes into your code makes it more cost some
you can pack nodes into function that will cost the total of the functions nodes - the call and return nodes
and the node cost puts each canvas into diffrent tiers depending on how many nodes your code uses.

the nodes:

move (right, left, up, down)

increment/decrement [r, g, b, a] at [location]

if not zero
elif

call function
return [None, r, g, b, a, location]
