world = 16 * 16
canvasSize = 32 * 64
values = range(255 * 255 * 255) // not very plesant with ery color schemes. The final
(a alternative would be that, the rgb values represent three diffrent values, and alpha is age)

inventory = canvasSize

version 1.0 : TURN_BASED ; FAST_PACED
input seed: coming soon


position should only interact with said position in said way, minimalistic

for example:
+----+
|.;:2|
|,dco|
+----+
consider .

what is taken in to account is the position of rule .
the rule at the position = .
the rule of position (choosen between turns) xy for d
the rule of the position = d (100 in ascii)

rule range
read / write

read from node .
perform value write
for starters one input rule and one output rule
then scale so multiple rule-nodes can be used for input and out put

for example like a fragment grenade can blow up on one node and place fragments further away.

so it costs energy to move at a faster speed. But only the relative postions and speeds should be considered.
in conclusion, nodes at a postion requires more cost to interact with the rule.
question is can every own a rule, act a certain way with all other rules.

so the task is to generate a system that balance it self
and then maybe canvases fight each other or form a clan idfk. online or AI, swarm's of Canvases, but each with limited space.
So Distance matters, obviously.
the cost of the rules which is deemed the fairest by the system.
so the cheepest starting seed will set the standard for the rest of the system
either by opinion

so a canvas is valued at
# of starting node with the intensity of the total value
how far apart the are, the entire canvas density.



you can create a gravity field around a certain node perhaps.
something like
.
|
+---d

cost 2 down and 4 right (2^2 + 4^2)^.5 = 4.472

rule is 
if . is 

custom starting terrain, of course

so you set your rules then you get other rules from other canvases. maybe and se if you can survive the other one's rules
and who ever survive get's a new rule node. until you filled out your canvas and it becomes bigger (singleplayer primarly).

then either you win or you get a new sized canvas, (or in online your just the master until someone defeats you).
colide the two canvases like floating landscapes then battle.
and you get to name your canvas setups iguess. Done!
