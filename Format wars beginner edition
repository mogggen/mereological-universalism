8 bytes per player
overflows are discarded but counted as a step
the bf variation says that [] only exits once a range is reach.
the sum of your card starts at 50, and the player can assign them freely.
it will rise as the values of the bytes does so each player has an incentive to raise it and lower their opponent's 
if a player gets all their bytes to a value of 255 (overflow is not a thing) they will win the game.
if a player gets all their bytes to a value of 0 (underflow is not a thing) they will lose the game.
