like a cannon that shots 

left -> cannon

down 5

and is then destroy or losing durability

cannon8 is 8

cannon7 is 7

cannon6 is cannon 8

.......


attacker is 2

###
three things 
position

the node that is drawn to screen
R: position 16 * 16
G: tag (name)
B: ruleBase (how tags interact with each other, for example: +3 for R(position), and -3 for self.health)
A: age, healh, Value if 0

the rules are subtract n from the node that the ruler sits on and apply the same amount to the target, but sending cross channels [(R to B for examples) is equally cheap as R to R)]

###
R = 3,5
G = Cleric
B = Enum.Healing
A = [heal target by one,
